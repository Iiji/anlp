You are an expert Sokoban solver. You have been given the current state of a Sokoban puzzle as an image, where the green icon represents the player, the brick pattern represents walls, the red squares represents targets, the yellow boxes are the boxes to be pushed by the player, and the black areas are empty spaces. In each step, the player can move one block along the 4 directions, to an empty space or push the box on that direction (if there is space to push them into).

Analyze the puzzle and determine a proper next move that potentially leads all boxes to their designated target squares. Follow these steps:

- **State Understanding**: Briefly describe the positions of the player, boxes, and targets. Here, the position is represented by the coordinates `(x, y)`, where `x` is the row number from top to bottom, `y` is the column number from left to right, starting from the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.
- **Surrounding Understanding**: Describe what's in the four adjacent cells of the player, and what's in the cells that are 2 cells away from the player.
- **Move Prediction**: Describe what would happen if the player makes a move on all 4 directions.
- **Decision**: Considering the results above, determine the best next move, and output as an individual line: `MOVE: {left/right/up/down}`.

Below is the reference template of your response. Your should fill proper contents into the brackets {} in your output. 

```
From the image, we can summarize the following information:
Player Position: {(x, y)}
Remaining out of place Box Position: {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...}
Remaining Empty Target Position: {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...}
Objects on the 4 directions are: 
Left: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Target/Target}
Right: {...}
Top: {...}
Bottom: {...}
Objects on positions that are 2 cells away: 
Left-Left: {...}
Right-Right: {...}
Top-Top: {...}
Bottom-Bottom: {...}
Top-Left: {...}
Top-Right: {...}
Bottom-Left: {...}
Bottom-Right: {...}

Based on the current state, this is what would happen if I try to move on the 4 directions:
Left: {move to an empty space / push the box along that direction / get blocked by a wall / get blocked by an unmovable box}
Right: {...}
Top: {...}
Bottom: {...}

{customized reasoning steps...} Considering the current situation, my next move would be {"left/right/up/down"}
MOVE: {left/right/up/down}
```

A valid response following the template may look like this:

```
From the image, we can summarize the following information:
Player Position: (8, 6)
Remaining out of place Box Position: (7, 4), (8, 7)
Remaining Empty Target Position: (7, 5), (8, 4)
Objects on the 4 directions are: 
Left: Empty
Right: Box
Top: Empty
Bottom: Wall
Objects on positions that are 2 cells away: 
Left-Left: Target
Right-Right: Empty
Top-Top: Wall
Bottom-Bottom: Wall
Top-Left: Target
Top-Right: Empty
Bottom-Left: Wall
Bottom-Right: Wall

Based on the current state, this is what would happen if I try to move on the 4 directions:
Left: move to an empty space
Right: push the box along that direction
Up: move to an empty space
Down: get blocked by a wall

Considering the current situation, my next move would be "left"
MOVE: left
