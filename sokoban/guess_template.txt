(for all coordinates, x-axis is counted from left to right, y-axis is counted from top to bottom, starting from (0,0))


From the image, we can summarize the following information:
Player Position: {(x, y)}
Remaining Empty Goal Position: {(x1, y1), (x2, y2)}
Objects on the 4 directions are: 
Left: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Right: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Top: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Bottom: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Objects on positions that are 2 cells away: 
Left-Left: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Right-Right: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Top-Top: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Bottom-Bottom: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Top-Left: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Top-Right: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Bottom-Left: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}
Bottom-Right: {Wall/Empty/Box/Box on Goal/Goal}

Based on the current state, this is what would happen if I try to move on the 4 directions:
Left: {move to an empty space / push the box along that direction / get blocked by a wall / get blocked by a box}
Right: {move to an empty space / push the box along that direction / get blocked by a wall / get blocked by a box}
Top: {move to an empty space / push the box along that direction / get blocked by a wall / get blocked by a box}
Bottom: {move to an empty space / push the box along that direction / get blocked by a wall / get blocked by a box}

Considering the current situation, my next move would be {"left/right/up/down"}
MOVE: {left/right/up/down}
