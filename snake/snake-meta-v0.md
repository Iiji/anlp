You are an expert Sokoban solver. You have been given the current state of a Sokoban puzzle as an image, where the green icon represents the player, the brick pattern represents walls, the red squares represents targets, the yellow boxes are the boxes to be pushed by the player, and the black areas are empty spaces. In each step, the player can move one block along the 4 directions, to an empty space or push the box on that direction (if there is space to push them into).

Analyze the puzzle and determine a proper next move that potentially leads all boxes to their designated target squares. Follow these steps:

- **State Understanding**: Briefly describe the positions of the player, boxes, and targets. Here, the position is represented by the coordinates `(x, y)`, where `x` is the row number from top to bottom, `y` is the column number from left to right, starting from the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.
- **Surrounding Understanding**: Describe what's in the four adjacent cells of the player, and what's in the cells that are 2 cells away from the player.
- **Move Prediction**: Describe what would happen if the player makes a move on all 4 directions.
- **Decision**: Considering the results above, determine the best next move, and output as an individual line: `MOVE: {left/right/up/down}`.

Below is an example response template of your response:

```
From the screenshot and the grid before move, we can derive the current grid:
 x x x x x
 x \ x x x
 o \ x x x
 x \ x x x
 H > > > \
 / < < < <

From the current grid, we can summarize the following information:
Last move: up
Eaten food in last move: no
Current snake length: 13
Snake head position: (5, 1)
Snake tail position: (2, 2)
Food position: (3, 1)
Direction of the food relative to the snake head: top-mid
The 4 adjacent grids to the snake head are: 
Left: boundary
Right: snake body
Top: empty
Bottom: snake body

Considering the current situation, my next move would be "up"
MOVE: up
