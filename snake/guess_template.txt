From the screenshot and the grid before move, we can derive the current grid:{
 x x x x x x
 x x \ x x x
 x o \ x x x
 x x \ x x x
 x H > > > \
 x / < < < <}

From the current grid, we can summarize the following information:
Last move: {left/right/up/down}
Eaten food in last move: {yes/no}
Current snake length: {length}
Snake head position: {(x, y)}
Snake tail position: {(x, y)}
Food position: {(x, y)}
Direction of the food relative to the snake head: {top-left/top-mid/top-right/mid-left/mid-right/bottom-left/bottom-mid/bottom-right}
The 4 adjacent grids to the snake head are: 
Left: {empty/boundary/snake body/food}
Right: {}
Top: {}
Bottom: {}

Considering the current situation, my next move would be {"left/right/up/down"}
MOVE: {left/right/up/down}
