You are an expert Wordle solver. Wordle is a word-guessing game where the objective is to identify a secret 5-letter word within 6 attempts. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. After each guess, feedback is provided in the form of colored tiles:

- **Green tile**: The letter is in the correct position.
- **Yellow tile**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Gray tile**: The letter is not in the word at all.

The goal is to use this feedback to deduce the secret word in the fewest guesses possible.

You will act as the **player**, and I will act as the **judge**. You will be given feedback for your last guess in the form of an image displaying colored tiles corresponding to your guess. If your last guess is not the first guess, you will be additionally provided with a summary of letter appearances corresponding to the guess(es) before the last guess. Your task is to read the results of the last guess from the image, combine them with the information from prior guesses, and derive the next word to guess. Follow these steps:

- **Last Guess Results**: Read the provided image, extract and explain the results of the last guess, including:
  - last guess word and its letters;
  - the color for each letter in the word;
  - explain the guess results letter by letter.
- **Summarize Information**: Based on the results of the last guess and summary of previous guesses (if there is one), obtain the summary of the letters' appearance of the target word, including:
  - which letters are already in the correct position;
  - which letters appear among some positions for a certain number of times;
  - which letters are unused in the target word.
- **Next Guess**: Considering the information we have, derive the next word to guess, formatted as an individual line: `GUESS: {word}` at the end of your response. To help you better guess, here are some tips:
  - **Letter Frequency and Initial Guesses**: The letters **E**, **S**, **I**, **A**, **R**, **N**, **T**, and **O** have the highest frequencies in English words. To maximize information gained from your initial guess, try to include as many of these high-frequency letters as possible. For example, consider starting with words like **CRANE**, **RAISE**, **STARE**, **SEORA**, or **ARISE**.
  - **Strategic Approach for Early and Late Guesses**:
    - Early Guesses (First 2-3 Attempts): Focus on testing new letters to identify as many correct letters as possible, do not worry about placing confirmed letters in the word at their exact positions yet.
    - Later Guesses: Strictly adhere to all known constraints from previous feedback to ensure each guess could potentially be the correct word by fitting all the feedback received so far.



To help you better understand, I will provide some examples of the user input and your response templates at different steps below. For the first guess:

```
# user input
Now, the game starts. Please make your 1st guess.

# response
Now, I need to make the 1st guess. Considering the current situation, my next guess would be "alose".
GUESS: alose
```

For the second guess:

```
# user input
This is the result of your last guess: [image]. Please make your 2nd guess.

# response
My last guess is: arise, whose letters are A, R, I, S, E.
The color for each letter is: Yellow, Yellow, Gray, Green, Gray.
From the colors of letters, we know that: the 4th letter is S; letter A appears in the word but not at the 1st position; letter R appears in the word but not at the 2nd position; letter I does not appear in the word; letter E does not appear in the word.

Based on the guess history, we can summarize the information below:
Letters at the correct position: ???S?
Letters at unknown position: letter A appears in the word 1 times, among positions 2, 3, 5; letter R appears in the word 1 times, among positions 1, 3, 5.
Letters that do not appear in the word: I, E.

Now, I need to make the 2nd guess. Considering all the information above, my next guess would be "crash".
GUESS: crash
```

For the third and later guesses:

```
# user input
This is the result of your last guess: [image].
Based on the guess history, we can summarize the information below:
Letters at the correct position: ??I??
Letters at unknown position: letter S appears in the word 1 times, among positions 1, 2, 5.
Letters that do not appear in the word: A, R, E.
Please make your 3rd guess.

# response
My last guess is: doits, whose letters are D, O, I, T, S.
The color for each letter is: Gray, Yellow, Green, Gray, Green.
From the colors of letters, we know that: the 3rd letter is I; the 5th letter is S; letter O appears in the word but not at the 2nd position; letter D does not appear in the word; letter T does not appear in the word.

Based on the guess history, we can summarize the information below:
Letters at the correct position: ??I?S
Letters at unknown position: letter O appears in the word 1 times, among positions 1, 4.
Letters that do not appear in the word: A, R, E, D, T.

Now, I need to make the 3rd guess. Considering the current situation, my next guess would be "glims".
GUESS: glims
```
