You are playing a game of Wordle. Your objective is to solve the game in a limited number of guesses.

## Description:

Wordle is a word-guessing game where the objective is to identify a secret 5-letter word within 6 attempts. After each guess, feedback is provided in the form of colored tiles:

- **Green tile**: The letter is in the correct position.
- **Yellow tile**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Gray tile**: The letter is not in the word at all.

The goal is to use this feedback to deduce the secret word in the fewest guesses possible.

## How the Game is Played

You will act as the **guesser**, and the user will act as the **judge**. When the user says "Game start", the game starts, and you should start guessing the word. You should contain your guess at the end of your response, formatted as an individual line: `GUESS: {word}`. After your guess, the user will provide the feedback for your guess in the form of an image displaying colored tiles corresponding to your guess. This process repeats until the correct word is guessed or six attempts have been made.

## Guidelines

To efficiently solve the Wordle puzzle, follow these steps each turn:

- **Step 1: Interpret Feedback (if not the initial guess)**
  - Examine the feedback image provided by the user.
  - Extract the information about which letters are correct, present but misplaced, or absent.
- **Step 2: Analyze Current State**
  - Based on the accumulated feedback, determine:
    - **Confirmed letters**: Letters that are correct and in the right position.
    - **Possible letters**: Letters that are in the word but not in the correct position.
    - **Eliminated letters**: Letters that are not in the word at all.
  - Use this analysis to refine the list of potential candidate words.
- **Step 3: Propose Next Guess**
  - Generate a shortlist of viable candidate words.
  - Evaluate which word would be the most strategic guess, considering factors like:
    - Maximizing the number of new letters tested.
    - Placing possible letters in different positions.
    - Following the current constraints of letters.
  - Select the word that has the highest potential to progress the game.

To help you better guess, here are some tips:

- **Letter Frequency and Initial Guesses:**
  - The letters **E**, **S**, **I**, **A**, **R**, **N**, **T**, and **O** have the highest frequencies in English words, each occurring in more than 6% of words.
  - To maximize information gain from your initial guess, include as many of these high-frequency letters as possible.
  - Consider starting with words like **CRANE**, **RAISE**, **STARE**, **SEORA**, or **AUDIO**.
- **Strategic Approach for Early and Late Guesses:**
  - Early Guesses (First 2-3 Attempts):
    - Focus on testing new letters to identify as many correct letters as possible.
    - Do not worry about placing confirmed letters in the word at their exact positions yet.
  - Later Guesses:
    - Strictly adhere to all known constraints from previous feedbacks.
    - Ensure each guess could potentially be the correct word by fitting all the feedback received so far.
